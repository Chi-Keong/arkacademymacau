## About the instructor

- Based in Macau
- Background: [add your degree / experience here]
- Experience: [tutoring, teaching, data work—whatever fits you]

I started Ark Academy because many students tell me:

> "I can follow the formula in class, but I don't *really* understand what's going on."

My goal is to fix that by explaining statistics in plain language, using:
- Simple visuals
- Real-world examples
- Gradual, structured practice
